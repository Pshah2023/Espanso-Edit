# Espanso-Edit
Simply put, allows quick modifying of espanso matches through a visual editor activited through shortcuts.

Using GUIs!
With about two more dialogs, this could become an espanso gui in the make.
I'll update this soon as soon as I get some time.

I'd appreciate any watches or favorite!
