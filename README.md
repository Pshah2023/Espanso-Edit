# Espanso-Edit
Simply put, allows quick modifying of espanso matches

However, it allows this through the use of guis!
With about twice the number of lines (200 or so), this could become an espanso gui in the make.
I'll update this soon as soon as I get some time.

I'd appreciate any watches or favorite!
